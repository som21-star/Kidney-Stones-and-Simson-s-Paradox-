# Kidney-Stones-and-Simson-s-Paradox-
In this project, I worked with medical data published in 1986 in "The British Medical Journal" where the effectiveness of two types of kidney stone removal treatments (A - open surgery and B - percutaneous nephrolithotomy) were compared. I used multiple logistic regression and visualize model output to help the doctors determine if there is a difference between the two treatments.
